### About the blog

{: style="text-align: justify;"}
I believe that our lives are big under-construction libraries. A massive collection of stories and memories to share.

{: style="text-align: justify;"}
**The Unknown Explorer** is born out of the sheer need to share these stories with those who want to listen and live through my experiences. Through this blog I bring to you my shared collection of journeys around India and the world, sharing my experiences with the place and experiments with the cuisines. I am a foodie who lives for the love of adventure and passion for storytelling.


### About Me

{: style="text-align: justify;"}
Hi, I am **Karan Nagpal!** I am a techie during the day and an explorer during the night.

{: style="text-align: justify;"}
I am a person who will pick up his bag and run towards the hills (or the sea, whichever is closer) at the tiniest hint of an opportunity. My travel style is that of a curious individual, who will try to explore everything within his reach, and take back the good with him. I love collecting stories from the places I visit and bring them to my readers in the most interesting way possible.

{: style="text-align: justify;"}
*P.S. I love jumping off from airplanes, cliffs and exploring the sea life.*
